# XMLAnalysis
XML Analysis with SWRL

The tool serves to analyze the semantic content of XML documents. With this aim, XML resources are mapped into an OWL ontology and SWRL rules are used for specifying XML semantic content. The implementation is based on a semantic web library for XQuery which includes primitives for mapping XML into OWL, and for specifying and executing SWRL.
